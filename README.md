## Introduction

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that is often curable if detected and treated early. This project focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence and image analysis to provide a tool for the early detection of melanoma. By analyzing images of skin lesions, we can help healthcare professionals and individuals identify potential melanoma cases in their early stages.
